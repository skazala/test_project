# test_project

This is a simple PHP-project which implements MVC architecture and OOP principles. 
It allows you:
- to register a new customer in a shop (adding loyalty card for every customer);
- to search for customers in DB (by name, by surname, by card number);
- to create reports (e.g. top 10 customers in the past month).
